    Hello! Thanks for stopping by my personal website.
</p>
<p>
    I'm Aarav Sane, a Computer Science Doctorate Student at Purdue University with a deep passion for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. My journey in computer science has been driven by curiosity and a desire to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI.
</p>
<p>
    Before pursuing my doctorate, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree at the University of California, Riverside, where I not only excelled academically but also had the honor of playing and captaining the NCAA Division I tennis team. This experience taught me the value of discipline, teamwork, and perseverance—qualities that I bring to my research and academic work.
</p>
<p>
    My research interests span across various domains of machine learning, including deep learning for computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and federated learning systems. I'm particularly fascinated by how we can make AI systems more efficient, interpretable, and accessible while maintaining high performance.
</p>
<p>
    When I'm not working on research or coding, you might find me on a tennis court, exploring new technologies, or diving into the latest papers in machine learning. I believe that the best solutions come from interdisciplinary thinking and collaboration.
</p>
<p>
    I'm always open to discussing research, potential collaborations, or just chatting about AI and technology. Feel free to reach out!
